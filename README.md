# Earth-Lens
This project presents the design and implementation of a complete system for acquiring and enhancing real-time Earth imagery transmitted by NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) weather satellites—specifically NOAA 15, NOAA 18, and NOAA 19—via their Automatic Picture Transmission (APT) signals. Utilizing publicly available WebSDR platforms and open-source decoding tools. analog APT signals are captured, processed, and converted into visible satellite images. The decoded images often suffer from noise and signal degradation, which are mitigated using image enhancement techniques such as Gaussian and median filtering. To further improve visual clarity, advanced methods like the Hough Transform are employed to detect and reconstruct corrupted line segments. In addition, K-means clustering, is applied to segment and map key geographic features such as land, water bodies, and cloud formations. The project not only provides hands-on insight into satellite communication and remote sensing but also demonstrates a cost-effective approach for Earth observation using publicly accessible technologies. The resulting system lays a foundation for educational and environmental applications, including weather monitoring and geospatial analysis.
